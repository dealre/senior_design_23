## Project Abstract
The project is to create an exploitation framework that has different payloads on it that can go into different devices and provide an effect. My plan is to take a few devices and make exploits for them, for example;  
- an exploit that will make a printer send a copy of every file sent to it to back to the exploiter
- an exploit that will turn on a laptop webcam without the light, and send images to the exploiter
- so on
