The goal of the project is to create a software tool that can be used to penetrate a system with known or otherwise identified vulnerabilities. 
The goal is also to have a number of systems in place to manage the target machineâ€™s logs, set up/manage backdoors, and maintain connections. 
The Idea is to demonstrate the way in which bad actors can use relatively simple exploits on what is considered modern machinery. 
The tool is also a good chance to learn about the specific real world application of how ideas of computer security in a formal learning institution 
are applied in real world examples.
